## Background Introduction

*"Let's Chat"*，is the name of my chat app which is developed for my friends in Stevens Institute of Technology<br/>

<a name="项目介绍"></a>
## Projecte Introduction

*"let's chat"* is designed for a class of Stevens Institute of Technology, can be used under the campus wifi. The main aim to develop this app is to finish a real android app and understand **Http Requests** and **Http Response** more clearly  <br>

This project includes two parts, **Server** and **Let's Chat app**

**Server** is used to receive Https Requests and give response to the app.

**let's Chat** contains the front-end and back-end, 

Front-end: designed layout and icon to create a new chatting room, send messages, read the message record, show the position of every user.

Back-end, designed SQLite database to store the information of our user, implemented RESTful frame to send **Http Requests** and Receive **Http Response**

tile now, the server and Let's Chat itself has already finished but I have not deploy it on the internet, you can try it if you are interested in my app~
